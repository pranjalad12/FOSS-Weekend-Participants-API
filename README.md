# FOSS Weekend Participants API

## About
This is an API with data on all participants of IIIT-L Equinox's FOSS Weekend (that's you!) with 2 endpoints currently, one which returns data on all the participants and another which returns data on the participant with the requested roll number. All data is in JSON format. 2 endpoints sounds too little? Don't worry, you can add more (look at the Issues tab 👀)

Tackling issue #1 is MANDATORY for all participants. Don't miss it!

## Local Setup
- After forking and cloning this repository to your local machine, open the project folder in your favourite code editor. 
- In the terminal, ensuring you are in the project folder, run `npm i` to install all the dependencies
- To start the development server, run `npm run devStart`. You should see some output ending with `listening at http://localhost:3000/ in development` Go to this link to see the server in action. In case you need to stop the server (though you probably won't need to), just press `ctrl + C`
- After making any changes to the code, refresh the browser to see how it affects the results.

Pro tip: To run any other commands in the terminal (like git commands), you don't need to stop the development server, just open another instance of the terminal (in VS Code, press the little plus sign to the top right of the terminal)
